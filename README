Forewords
=========

This tutorial takes you a roller coaster in order for you to have some
insight of Scala language usage, sbt build system, and akka -- one of
the most popular frameworks built in Scala.

This tutorial assumes the audience to have no knowledge and experience
of the Java/Scala world but some basics of other worlds -- e.g. C, C++,
Python, or whatever. I just wanted to record and share my self-taught-y
way to learn Scala with "framework first for the first learning" mind.

The target platform is GNU/Linux. Therefore, for the installation step,
extra efforts may be required depending on your environment. Since
I am currently running Arch, simply pacman is used.

Also note that there is no IDE-specific instructions: No Eclipse or
IntelliJ, just sbt (I don't find reasons to take efforts for learning
any IDE which I am not sure to use beyond this tutorial).


Installation
============

There seems no need to separately install the language Scala since the
build tool sbt itself is capable of installing and running different
versions of sbt and scala.

Of course sbt requires Java 8


$ sudo pacman -S jdk8-openjdk sbt


sbt Tutorial
============

Before trying the Akka tutorial, at least I must learn how to use the
build tool, namely sbt. So this time I visit the official sbt webpage
and take the tutorial (scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Getting-Started.html).


Hello, tutorial
---------------


$ sbt new sbt/scala-seed.g8
# If it is your first time to launch sbt, it will take a very long time
# to set up, but not again.

A minimal Scala project.

name [Scala Seed Project]: tutorial

Template applied in ./tutorial

$ cd tutorial
$ sbt
sbt:Hello> run  # must success
sbt:Hello> test  # must success
sbt:Hello> exit
$


Below are sbt commands used frequently:
* run
* runMain
* test
* compile
* console
* reload
* clean
* help <command>

The sbt documentation is quite heavy (even for the getting started
section) and it seems beyond my level. I terminate this tutorial at the
end of "1.g. Scopes", heading for a dive on Akka.


Akka Quickstart with Scala
==========================

I arrive at the quickstart guide for Akka.
(developer.lightbend.com/guides/akka-quickstart-scala/)

Here it supplies the source code for the example as a zipped file to be
downloaded. As I get that and unzip, I found that the example source
contains sbt, which does not look good for me to experience sbt on my
machine. Therefore I continue to work with my previous sbt project for
"Hello World".

I create two `quickstart` directories for `src/main` and `src/test` to
write the code.


Main class
----------

I write companions for `Painter` and `Greeter`, and the main `App`,
reading through the Quickstart guide, from the beginning to the section
"Full Example Code".

* If you are curious of what is the companion object, please check
"Basics" and "Basic continued" sections from "Scala Shool" provided
by Twitter (twitter.github.io/scala_school)

Then sbt detects the currently existing two main classes.


$ sbt
sbt:Hello> run
[warn] Multiple main classes detected.  Run 'show discoveredMainClasses' to see the list

Multiple main classes detected, select one to run:

 [1] example.Hello

I can choose the main class to run by


sbt:Hello> runMain quickstart.AkkaQuickstart


I am not sure (and probably do not think) that this is a good way to
maintain a serious Scala project, but it is good for the tutorial
objective.
