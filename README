Forewords
=========

This tutorial takes you a roller coaster in order for you to have some
insight of Scala language usage, sbt build system, and akka -- one of
the most popular frameworks built in Scala.

This tutorial assumes the audience to have no knowledge and experience
of the Java/Scala world but some basics of other worlds -- e.g. C, C++,
Python, or whatever. I just wanted to record and share my self-taught-y
way to learn Scala with "framework first for the first learning" mind.

The target platform is GNU/Linux. Therefore, for the installation step,
extra efforts may be required depending on your environment. Since
I am currently running Arch, simply pacman is used.

Also note that there is no IDE-specific instructions: No Eclipse or
IntelliJ, just sbt (I don't find reasons to take efforts for learning
any IDE which I am not sure to use beyond this tutorial).


Installation
============

There seems no need to separately install the language Scala since the
build tool sbt itself is capable of installing and running different
versions of sbt and scala.

Of course sbt needs Java 8

$ sudo pacman -S jdk8-openjdk sbt
